Instagram Bot

This bot uses a multitude of different files and libraries for automating basic instagram tasks, such as liking posts, watching stories, following users, and unfollowing users.

PSA: Make sure your chrome version is updated and compatible with your chromedriver, else you will not be able to do the browser automation tasks thru chrome. 

Follow_data retrieves and alters the text files used to follow and unfollow users. It works with the bots to filter and retrieve the proper people.

Bot firefox uses the firefox browser and instapy library to scrape follow data from a user or compare your following to another users. It stores said data into text files.

Bot chrome is the primary bot used in this project. It retrieves the follow data and actually goes thru each user individually and performs an action (follow/unfollow). It also handles liking posts and watching stories

THis bot has been tested to be virtually undetected by instagram, by using methods such as sleeping between actions and liking posts and watching stories rather than just following a bunch of people and logging off. Use accordingly.
